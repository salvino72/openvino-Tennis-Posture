OpenVINO: Deciphering Tennis Posture with Artificial Intelligence

Discover how AI can revolutionize the world of tennis by analyzing players' posture in detail. Thanks to OpenVINO, the application provides valuable feedback on styles and techniques, taking training to the next level.

At this moment it is a basic version, just for the purpose of testing the efficiency of some technologies. For an educational purpose we only analyze some behaviors and shots made by the tennis player.

In tennis, every detail counts. As coaches seek every advantage possible, technology emerges as an essential ally in providing valuable insights. It's not just about more advanced rackets or lighter sneakers, but also how AI can help decipher the nuances of human movement. Our application, backed by the power of OpenVINO, aims to do just that: analyze a tennis player's posture, offering detailed information on their techniques and movements.

Human movement analysis plays a fundamental role in improving athletic performance, especially in complex sports such as tennis. The ability to automatically recognize and evaluate specific poses during a game can offer valuable insights to players and their coaches.

In the context of tennis, one of the most technical and crucial movements, for example, is the serve. Using the human pose estimation model, human-pose-estimation-0005, you can analyze each frame of a video sequence and precisely identify the position of the player's joints.
